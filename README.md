**Interacting with MySQL using PDO-PHP**


## What is PDO-PHP ?
This files shows how to interact with db safely and efficiently (atleast i think :p)

## config.php
This file holds the db configuration like username, password, host and database..

## user.php
This file is user model class

## how-to.php
This file shows how to use these files.

## Suggestion?
Anyone can help make this better - Because I am no pro in PHP, just a beginner and a learner..
